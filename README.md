# Virtual Try-On App

## Project Overview
The Virtual Try-On App provides a platform for users to virtually try on outfits using their face images. Users can upload their own face images, select outfits and accessories from an inventory, and see how they look in real-time. Administrators can manage and upload new outfit items, making it easy to expand the inventory.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` or `admin.html` in any modern web browser to run the application. This project leverages Firebase, so ensure you set up Firebase for the app with your own configuration.

3. Replace the Firebase configuration in `script.js` with your own:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com"
   };
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the app in a browser.
2. **Admin Section**: Use `admin.html` to upload new outfit items by selecting images and entering item details. 
3. **Customer Section**: Use the customer interface in `index.html` to upload a face image (from your device or capture with a webcam), select outfits from the available inventory, and preview the combinations.

## Features
- **User Interface**: Clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Firebase Integration**: Upload and manage outfit items with Firebase Storage and Database.
- **Image Uploads**: Allow users to upload their face images and preview selected outfits.
- **Real-time Updates**: As users select different items, the outfit preview updates in real-time.
- **Admin Panel**: Provide a simple interface for admins to add new fashion items to the inventory.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following dependencies:
- **Firebase**: For storage and real-time database functionalities.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the UI.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons in the application.
